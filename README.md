# Jackson-portfolio
Portfolio of Jackson's work done over the course of the internship to present for college credit.

This includes four major projects:
1. Script-Emporium-Revamp

This project consists of the python_ser and rust_ser directories. These directories contain the scripts re-worked in python and rust respectively as part of the ongoing script-emporium-revamp project. These are mainly file parsing tools that are run from the command line. This is a very important part of my future career, and I'm sure I will need to work on projects like these in the future.

2. Exporters

This project, part of a larger library, is a re-make and expansion of existing metadata upload pipelines. This section of code is designed too interact with a SQLite database and turn excel files into uploadable content to define population study metadata.

3. IpumsDB (DBReports)

This CLI app is designed to generate .csv or .xlsx files as "reports" pulled out of a database that allow for a user to view, edit, and re-upload back into the database to edit it. These reports are customizable in .toml files. A user unfamiliar with SQL can use this to be able to interact with a database like they wouldn't previously be. 

4. Ipums-Metadata-Models (ORM)

This repository is an ORM; an Object Relational Mapper. This tool is a piece of software designed to translate between the data representations used by databases and those used in object-oriented programming. I was reponsible for building out a decent-sized chunk of this work, and have already used it to talk about my work in job interviews as a signficant project I worked on.

Note: these scripts have enough dependencies that they should not/will not run in this new Repo. DO NOT TRY TO. This is a relevant showcase of the work completed though.
